### <ins>**Libraries used**</ins>

All data analysis was performed in Python, using the following libraries:
    * Pandas
    * Numpy
    * Scikit-Learn
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn


### <ins>**Brief data description and transformations performed on it.**</ins>


There are 4 datasets on movies and series on different streaming platforms:
- Amazon:  `./data/amazon_prime_titles.csv`
- Disney plus: `./data/disney_plus_titles.csv`
- Hulu: `./data/hulu_titles.csv`
- Netflix: `./data/netflix_title.csv`

### <ins>**Columns description**</ins>

* show_id: cadena de caracteres que inicia con la letra `s`, seguida de `numeros`
* type: Movie/Tv Show
* title: Nombre de la serie o pelicula
* director: director de la serie o pelicula
* cast: reparto de actores/actrices
* country: pais de la filmacion	
* date_added: fecha en que fue agregada a la plataforma	
* release_year: aÃ±o de estreno original
* rating: clasificaciÃ³n (todo publico/+13...etc)
* duration: duracion, en minutos o en season/s
* listed_in: categoria de la pelicula (drama/comedia...)
* description: descripcion de la pelicula

## <ins>**Basic transformations performed**</ins>

### **Notebook: clean_platform.ipynb**<br>

1. A new `id` column was added, formed by the first letter of the platform and the `show_id`
2. Null values from `rating` column were replaced to "G" --> Mature audience
3. Dates were parsed from (Month_name day, year ) to (yyyy/mm/dd)
4. All text field were transformed to lowercase
5. In the Hulu dataset, values from the `duration` column had been mistakenly included in the `rating` column. This problem was fixed.
6. The NaNs in the `duration` column have been replaced by "0 min"
7. The `duration` column was split into two different columns (`duration_int` and `duration_type`)
8. With all these transformations, there are still several columns with missing data.<br>
> Probably many of the missing data from the `director`, `cast` and `country` columns of a dataset (for example Netflix) could be found in another dataset (e.g Amazon). **I leave it as a future task**
9. For now, all missing data will be replace with "unknown "+cast/country/...
10. A large dataframe was created, and the columns 'date_added' and 'duration' were dropped.
10. Save large dataframe to `/data/clean/all_together_clean.csv`

Note: *When work locally, I have saved each individual cleaned dataframe to a separate CSV file. But it were included in the .gitignore file*

### **Notebook: clean_rating.ipynb**<br>
> We need to concatenate the user reviews information, which is available in 8 .csv files
1. No missing data
2. We upload the 8 files and save the data in a big dataframe
3. We dropped `timestamp`  column
4. Column `rating` were renamed to  `score` to match up with nomenclature used in the platforms datasets
5. Save to `/data/clean/all_ratings.csv` (add to gitignore file because is too large)

---

### **Notebook: load_score_to_platform_data.ipynb**
We only merge users reviews with movie information, and save to `/data/clean/all_together_with_score`
